# Setup Vapor TIL for Vapor Cloud 2

Setting up the Vapor TIL app for Vapor Cloud 2 is fairly simple.

1. Start by following the quick start here: https://docs.v2.vapor.cloud/quick-start/

**NOTE:** For web.Dockerfile, and configure.swift you can follow the diff on this repo https://github.com/raywenderlich/vapor-til/compare/master...joscdk:master

2. After deploy, simply create a database from the applications view, and scale the application to one replica.
